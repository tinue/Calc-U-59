# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - TBD

**TI-58C emulation:** Fixed MEMWR/MEMRD instruction address decoding (Sout[1:0] are hex nibbles, not BCD). Implemented full field-mask support for partial RAM writes. Fixed deferred-write behavior and printer-detection digit selection. Expanded RAM from 60 to 64 registers to properly support constant-memory access.

**Preset files:** TI-58C files now support hidden register loading via H00–H03 syntax (e.g., `H01 = 7.77E22`), allowing direct access to the four special constant-memory registers (060–063) used for partition settings and validation. Quirky partition support (steps 480–511) removed; TI-58C now treats partition limits identically to TI-58 (max 479 steps, default 239).

**Constant memory:** TI-58C RAM persistence (`ti58c.mem`) switched from binary to human-readable text format. File now shows individual registers as hex bytes (e.g., `R000: 67 11 96 00 10 00 00 96`), making saved state transparent and editable. Only non-zero registers are written to keep files compact. Old binary `.mem` files are automatically detected and loaded on startup; load errors silently initialize RAM to zeros.

**Debugger:** Fixed live snapshot and register display to correctly show TI-58C's 64 displayable registers beyond the partition limit. Fixed debugger crashes on quirky partitions.

**Documentation:** Added `.ti58c` preset file example showing TI-58C repartitioning workflow. Updated `.ti59` state file format documentation to include hidden register syntax.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-06

**Emulation:** Added TI-58C ROM support and MEMWR/MEMRD constant-memory instructions (initial implementation; see 0.3.0 for critical bug fixes). Fixed 2nd Op 40 instruction. 'C' indicator now uses hardware-accurate SH-pin duty-cycle emulation with proper latch behavior and realistic afterglow. Printer mechanical busy timing matches real PC-100C hardware behavior.

**Debugging:** Binary execution trace facility (`TI59_TRACE.bin`) for advanced program analysis and verification against reference traces.

**Files:** iOS users can now access calculator state files via the public iCloud Drive folder; easier file management on iPad and iPhone.

**UI:** Card reader bar buttons show icon-only on narrow portrait screens (all iPhones; wide iPads are unaffected).

**Samples:** Added more samples, for example memory test preset files `ram_test.ti59` and `ram_test_full_fast.ti59` for hardware validation.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-30

Lowered deployment targets to macOS 15 (Sequoia) and iOS/iPadOS 18.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-29

Broken, do not use

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-28

Initial release.

**Emulation:** Cycle-accurate TI-59, TI-58, and TI-58C emulation. TI-58C constant memory survives restarts. Master Library ROM included.

**Preset files:** Load `.ti59` / `.ti58` state files to preset the calculator with a program and data registers.

**Card reader:** Magnetic card read/write simulation with file-based card storage.

**Printer:** Paper tape view with PC-100C dot-matrix font rendering. Copy output as text or high-resolution bitmap.

**Debugger:** Register inspection and keystroke injection (macOS and iPad landscape).

**Known limitations:** TI-58C emulation incomplete — MEMWR/MEMRD instructions not yet implemented; expect ROM hangs when TI-58C programs attempt constant-memory access. Printer output is functionally simulated — timing-sensitive printer interactions are not reproduced. The debug API is functional but early: expect the interface to evolve.
